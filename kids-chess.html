                    <p class="lead-text">Chess is more than just a game. It's a powerful tool that helps children develop critical thinking, patience, concentration, and problem-solving skills that benefit them throughout life.</p>
                    
                    <p>As a parent, you want the best for your child. You want activities that are both enjoyable and beneficial for their development. Chess offers exactly that. Through my personalized chess coaching, your child will learn a skill they'll cherish forever while developing mental abilities that improve their academic performance and overall confidence.</p>
                    
                    <p>I specialize in teaching kids because children learn chess differently than adults. They need patience, encouragement, and a teaching style that keeps them engaged and excited. My approach makes chess fun while building real skills that translate to better performance in school and life.</p>

                    <h3>Improves Concentration & Focus</h3>
                    <p>Chess trains children to focus on a single task for extended periods. This improved concentration directly helps with homework, reading, and classroom attention. Parents consistently report their children becoming more focused after starting chess.</p>

                    <h3>Develops Planning & Foresight</h3>
                    <p>Chess teaches children to think ahead and consider consequences before acting. This skill helps them plan homework, manage time better, and make thoughtful decisions in daily life.</p>

                    <h3>Teaches Sportsmanship & Respect</h3>
                    <p>Chess naturally teaches children to win graciously and lose with dignity. They learn to respect opponents, follow rules, and handle both victory and defeat maturely.</p>

                    <h3>Sharpens Logical Thinking</h3>
                    <p>Chess is pure logic. Every move requires cause-and-effect reasoning. Children develop systematic thinking skills that improve their ability to solve problems logically in school and beyond.</p>

                <h2>Common Questions from Parents</h2>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-list">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What age is best to start learning chess?</h3>
                    <p>Children can start learning chess as early as 6 years old, though some bright 5-year-olds can begin too. The ideal learning age is 7-12 when children have developed enough concentration but are still highly receptive to new skills. However, teenagers (13-16) can also learn excellently and often progress faster due to better strategic understanding.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long are the sessions for kids?</h3>
                    <p>For younger children (6-8 years), I recommend 30-45 minute sessions as their attention span is shorter. For children 9 and above, full 1-hour sessions work well. I'm flexible and adjust session length based on your child's energy and engagement level.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will my child get homework?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, but it's designed to be fun and stress-free. I provide light chess homework to help children stay mentally active between sessions. These activities improve focus, memory, and problem-solving while keeping learning enjoyable. Homework typically takes 10-15 minutes and includes puzzles, simple games, or pattern practice.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can chess really improve academic performance?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. Multiple studies show chess students perform better academically, especially in mathematics, reading comprehension, and critical thinking. Chess develops concentration, memory, logical reasoning, and problem-solving skills that directly transfer to academic work. Many parents report improved grades and homework focus after their children start chess.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is chess too difficult for my child to learn?</h3>
                    <p>Not at all! When taught properly at an age-appropriate pace, chess is quite accessible for children. I break everything down into simple, understandable concepts and use visual, hands-on methods. Most children grasp the basics within 4-6 sessions and can play enjoyable games within 2 months.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if my child loses interest or finds it boring?</h3>
                    <p>I specialize in keeping kids engaged through stories, puzzles, challenges, and making learning feel like play. If a child seems bored, I immediately adjust my teaching approach. However, chess is inherently engaging for children when taught well, as it's like solving puzzles and playing strategy games, which kids naturally enjoy.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should my child compete in tournaments?</h3>
                    <p>Competition is optional and depends entirely on your child's interest and personality. Some kids love the challenge of tournaments while others prefer casual play. I can prepare interested students for school tournaments, but there's no pressure to compete. Chess benefits your child whether they compete or not.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How will I know about my child's progress?</h3>
                    <p>I provide regular updates to parents about their child's development, what concepts we're covering, strengths I'm seeing, and areas we're working on. You're always welcome to ask questions or request updates. I believe in transparent communication with parents.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What makes your teaching different for kids?</h3>
                    <p>I specialize in kids because I understand they need patience, encouragement, and age-appropriate teaching. I make chess fun while building real skills. My approach combines structured learning with playful engagement. I'm not just teaching chess moves, I'm developing your child's thinking abilities and confidence.</p>
