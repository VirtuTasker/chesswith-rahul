                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Who is Rahul and what are his qualifications?</h3>
                    <p>I'm Rahul, a personal chess coach based in Mumbai and a multiple-time Inter-College Chess Competition Winner. I have years of competitive chess experience and specialize in teaching beginners, kids, adults, and players looking to improve their ratings. My teaching focuses on making chess accessible, enjoyable, and effective for students of all ages and skill levels.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I learn chess if I've never played before?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely! Most of my students start with zero chess knowledge. I specialize in teaching complete beginners and start from the absolute basics - how to set up the board, how each piece moves, and build systematically from there. My teaching method makes chess simple and accessible for anyone, regardless of age or background.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you offer a free trial session?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! The first session is completely free with no obligation. This allows you to experience my teaching style, assess compatibility, and understand the coaching structure before making any commitment. It's a no-risk way to see if my coaching is right for you.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How are sessions conducted - online or in-person?</h3>
                    <p>Sessions are conducted online through video call platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, or WhatsApp video). This provides maximum flexibility and convenience while maintaining full teaching effectiveness. I use digital chess boards during sessions so you can clearly see all positions and moves. Online sessions also mean no travel time, making it easier to fit into busy schedules.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What equipment or software do I need?</h3>
                    <p>You need a computer, tablet, or smartphone with internet connection for video sessions. I recommend eventually getting a physical chess board (₹200-500) for practice at home. For playing online between sessions, I can help you set up free accounts on platforms like Chess.com or Lichess. No expensive software or special equipment required.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you only teach in Mumbai or can people from other cities join?</h3>
                    <p>Since sessions are online, I can teach students from anywhere in India or even internationally. While I'm based in Mumbai and most of my students are from here, online coaching removes all geographical barriers. The only consideration is coordinating time zones for session scheduling.</p>

                    <h3>How much does chess coaching cost?</h3>
                    <p>Personal 1-on-1 chess coaching sessions are ₹800 per hour. For younger children (ages 6-8), I offer shorter 30-45 minute sessions at ₹600 per session, as their attention span is shorter. The first trial session is completely free so you can experience the teaching style before committing.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are there any package deals or discounts?</h3>
                    <p>I can offer package pricing for students committing to monthly sessions (4 sessions per month). Contact me on WhatsApp to discuss package options based on your learning goals and session frequency. The focus is on providing value through quality coaching rather than just discounting prices.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I make payments?</h3>
                    <p>Payments can be made through UPI, bank transfer, or online payment methods. I'll share payment details after we schedule your sessions. Payment is typically done session-by-session or at the start of the month for monthly packages.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is there a cancellation or refund policy?</h3>
                    <p>If you need to cancel a session, please inform me at least 24 hours in advance and we'll reschedule at no charge. Last-minute cancellations (less than 24 hours notice) may not be eligible for refund or rescheduling. I'm flexible and understand emergencies happen - we can discuss on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to pay for multiple sessions upfront?</h3>
                    <p>No, you can pay session-by-session if you prefer. However, students who commit to regular weekly sessions often opt for monthly packages for convenience. There's no pressure to commit long-term - we can start with individual sessions and see how it goes.</p>

                    <h3>How do I schedule sessions?</h3>
                    <p>Simply contact me on WhatsApp at +91-8591028709. We'll discuss your availability and schedule sessions at times that work for you. I offer flexible timing including early mornings, evenings, and weekends to accommodate different schedules.</p>

                    <h3>How long is each session?</h3>
                    <p>Standard sessions are 1 hour (60 minutes) for ages 9 and above. For younger children (ages 6-8), I recommend shorter 30-45 minute sessions as their attention span is limited. We can adjust session length based on the student's age, energy level, and preference.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How often should I take sessions?</h3>
                    <p>I recommend weekly 1-2 sessions for optimal progress. Weekly sessions allow time for practice between lessons while maintaining momentum. More frequent sessions (2-3 per week) are ideal for students with specific goals or those preparing for tournaments. The frequency ultimately depends on your goals, availability, and budget.</p>

                    <p>That's fine! Just inform me at least 24 hours in advance and we'll find an alternative time that works for both of us. I understand that schedules change and try to be as flexible as possible.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I take irregular sessions or only when available?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, though regular sessions are recommended for best progress. Some students prefer flexible scheduling due to work or school commitments. We can work on a schedule that suits you, whether it's weekly, bi-weekly, or irregular. Just keep in mind that consistency helps with faster improvement.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does it take to learn chess?</h3>
                    <p>You'll learn the basic rules and start playing enjoyable games within 4-6 sessions (about 1-1.5 months). Developing solid intermediate skills takes about 3-6 months with regular weekly practice. Chess is a lifelong learning journey - there's always more to discover and improve, which is what makes it so engaging!</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will I get homework or practice assignments?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. After each session, I provide simple and enjoyable practice tasks to reinforce what you learned. These are designed to keep your brain active and help concepts stick - typically tactical puzzles, positions to analyze, or practice games. Homework is optional but highly effective for faster improvement, usually taking 15-20 minutes per day.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I know if I'm improving?</h3>
                    <p>We track your progress through several methods: regular review of your games, monitoring your online rating (if you play rated games), noting concepts you've mastered, and observing tactical pattern recognition improvement. I provide feedback after each session and we periodically assess overall progress together.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I contact you between sessions with questions?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! I'm available on WhatsApp for quick questions about positions, concepts, or anything chess-related. While I can't provide full lessons via text, I'm happy to help with doubts or give brief guidance between sessions. Continuous support is part of the coaching experience.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to practice between sessions?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, regular practice between sessions significantly accelerates improvement. I recommend 15-30 minutes daily - solving tactical puzzles, playing practice games, or reviewing concepts. However, I understand people have busy lives. Even 3-4 practice days per week makes a big difference. The more you practice, the faster you improve.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I'm not improving as fast as expected?</h3>
                    <p>Chess improvement isn't always linear - plateaus are normal. If progress slows, we reassess your training approach, identify specific weaknesses, and adjust the learning plan. Different students progress at different rates, and that's perfectly fine. The key is consistent effort and the right guidance, which I provide.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What age is best to start learning chess?</h3>
                    <p>Children can start learning chess from age 6 onwards, though some bright 5-year-olds can begin too. The ideal learning age is 7-12 when children have developed sufficient concentration but are still highly receptive to new skills. Teenagers (13-16) can also learn excellently and often progress faster due to better strategic understanding.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will chess help my child's academic performance?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Studies consistently show chess students perform better academically, especially in mathematics, reading comprehension, and critical thinking. Chess develops concentration, memory, logical reasoning, and problem-solving skills that directly transfer to academic work. Many parents report improved grades and homework focus after their children start chess.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I know if the sessions are effective for my child?</h3>
                    <p>I provide regular updates to parents about their child's progress, concepts covered, strengths observed, and areas we're working on. You're always welcome to ask for updates or sit in on sessions. Most importantly, you'll notice your child's growing enthusiasm for chess and improved skills in actual games.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if my child loses interest or finds it boring?</h3>
                    <p>I specialize in keeping kids engaged through stories, puzzles, challenges, and making learning feel like play. If a child seems bored, I immediately adjust my teaching approach. Chess is inherently engaging for children when taught well - it's like solving puzzles and playing strategy games, which kids naturally enjoy.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you prepare my child for school tournaments?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely! If your child is interested in competing, I can provide tournament preparation including competitive strategies, time management, handling pressure, and tournament-specific training. However, competition is completely optional - chess benefits children whether they compete or not.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I sit with my child during online sessions?</h3>
                    <p>For the first session or two, it's helpful for parents to be present to ensure technical setup works smoothly. After that, most children do better without parents watching, as they feel more independent and comfortable making mistakes. However, you're always welcome to check in or observe if you'd like.</p>

            <div class="faq-list">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Am I too old to learn chess?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely not! I've successfully taught students in their 40s, 50s, 60s, and even 70s. Adults often learn faster than children because you can grasp strategic concepts more quickly and have better focus. Your age is not a barrier - it's actually an advantage in many ways because you bring life experience and analytical thinking to the game.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>I have a busy work schedule. Can I still learn chess effectively?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! That's why I offer flexible scheduling - early mornings, evenings, or weekends. You can do weekly or bi-weekly sessions based on availability. Chess can be practiced efficiently even with limited time - just 15-20 minutes of daily puzzles or practice games keeps skills sharp. Many working professionals successfully learn chess by fitting it around their schedule.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can chess really help with cognitive health and memory?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, research consistently supports this. Studies show chess helps maintain cognitive function, improves memory, and may reduce the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The mental exercise chess provides - planning, calculation, memory, problem-solving - keeps your brain active and engaged, which is crucial for healthy aging.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will you teach me differently than you teach children?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! My teaching approach for adults is different. I explain concepts more efficiently, use clear logical reasoning, focus on practical understanding rather than gamification, and respect your time and intelligence. Adults and children learn differently, and I adapt my teaching accordingly.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long will it take me to be able to play decent chess as an adult learner?</h3>
                    <p>Most adults learn the basics within 4-6 sessions and can play enjoyable games within 1-2 months. In 3 months of regular weekly sessions, you'll have solid fundamental skills. In 6 months, you can reach intermediate level with good tactical and strategic understanding. Adults often progress faster than children due to better conceptual understanding.</p>
