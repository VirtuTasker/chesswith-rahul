                <h2>Stuck Between 800-1100? Let's Break That Plateau.</h2>
                <p class="lead-text">You know the basics. You can play decent games. But your rating won't budge. You're stuck in the same range, winning some, losing some, but never breaking through to the next level.</p>
                
                <p>This is one of the most frustrating phases in chess improvement. You feel like you're working hard but not seeing results. Your rating hovers around 800-1100, and reaching 1200 seems impossible.</p>
                
                <p>Here's the truth: <strong>Breaking through rating plateaus isn't about working harder, it's about working smarter.</strong> The difference between a 900-rated player and a 1200-rated player isn't massive natural talent. It's specific skills, consistent patterns, and avoiding common mistakes.</p>
                
                <p>I specialize in helping players exactly like you break through this barrier. I've successfully coached dozens of students from the 800-1100 range to confidently playing at 1200+. I know exactly what's holding you back and precisely how to fix it.</p>

                    <h3>My Promise to You:</h3>
                    <p>With focused training, consistent practice, and the right guidance, you can reach 1200 Elo within 3-6 months. It's not magic—it's systematic skill development.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> You lose winning positions through one-move blunders. You miss your opponent's simple tactics.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Systematic tactical training, blunder-check routines, and developing tactical vision through pattern recognition.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> You play random opening moves without understanding principles. You get poor positions out of the opening.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Learn solid opening systems with clear plans. Understand ideas, not memorize moves.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Learn when to think deep vs. play quickly. Develop time management strategies for different game phases.</p>

                    <h3>Initial Assessment</h3>
                    <p>We analyze your recent games together to identify your specific strengths and weaknesses. I pinpoint exactly what's preventing your rating growth—whether it's tactical blindness, opening weaknesses, endgame gaps, or strategic understanding.</p>

                    <h3>Personalized Training Plan</h3>
                    <p>Based on the assessment, I create a customized training program targeting your biggest weaknesses first. This isn't generic advice—it's a specific roadmap designed for your chess profile and rating goals.</p>

                    <h3>Focused Skill Development</h3>
                    <p>We work systematically on each area: tactics, openings, strategy, endgames. I teach the specific patterns and techniques needed at the 1200 level. Every session builds on the previous one with clear progression.</p>

                    <h3>Practice & Application</h3>
                    <p>Between sessions, you get targeted practice exercises to reinforce what you learned. These aren't random puzzles—they're carefully selected positions that address your specific weaknesses and help ingrain winning patterns.</p>

                    <p>We regularly review your games together, identifying patterns in your play. I show you exactly where you're improving and where more work is needed. The training plan evolves as you progress.</p>

                    <h3>Rating Milestone Achievement</h3>
                    <p>As you systematically eliminate weaknesses and strengthen skills, your rating steadily climbs. Most students see noticeable improvement within 4-6 weeks and reach 1200+ within 3-6 months of consistent training.</p>

                <h2>Common Questions About Rating Improvement</h2>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-list">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does it take to reach 1200 from 800-1000?</h3>
                    <p>With consistent weekly training and regular practice, most students reach 1200 within 3-6 months. The exact timeline depends on your starting rating, time commitment, and consistency. Students who practice 20-30 minutes daily between sessions typically see faster improvement. Some highly dedicated students achieve it in 2-3 months.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I've been stuck at my rating for a long time?</h3>
                    <p>Perfect—you're exactly who this training is designed for. Long plateaus happen because you're repeating the same patterns and mistakes. My assessment will identify exactly what's holding you back, and we'll systematically fix those issues. Many students who were "stuck" for over a year broke through within a few months of focused training.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to study chess every day?</h3>
                    <p>Not "study" in the traditional sense, but regular practice is important. I recommend: one coaching session per week (1 hour), 15-20 minutes of tactical puzzles daily, and playing 2-3 rated games per week. This totals about 30-40 minutes per day, which is very manageable even with a busy schedule.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will you help me build an opening repertoire?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. We'll create a simple, solid opening repertoire that suits your style and is appropriate for the 1200 level. I don't teach complicated theoretical lines—I teach openings with clear plans and ideas that you can understand and remember. The goal is getting good positions you know how to play.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the biggest mistake players make when trying to improve?</h3>
                    <p>Unfocused practice. They play hundreds of games without analyzing them, do random puzzles, watch videos without clear goals. Improvement requires targeted work on specific weaknesses. My training provides that focus—we work on exactly what's preventing your rating growth, not random chess content.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you guarantee I'll reach 1200?</h3>
                    <p>I can't guarantee a specific rating because chess improvement depends on your effort, consistency, and practice between sessions. What I can guarantee: a structured training plan, expert guidance, and proven methods. Students who follow the plan and put in the work consistently see significant rating improvement. Most reach 1200 within 6 months.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you provide homework or practice assignments?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. After each session, I provide targeted practice tasks to reinforce what we covered. These are simple and enjoyable exercises designed to build specific skills—tactical puzzles focused on your weaknesses, positions to analyze, opening lines to practice, or endgames to study. The homework is optional but highly effective for faster improvement.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I start improving but then plateau again?</h3>
                    <p>Plateaus are normal in chess improvement—they happen at every level. When you plateau, we reassess, identify new weaknesses that emerged at the higher level, and adjust the training plan. Continuous improvement is about continuously evolving your training focus as your chess evolves.</p>
