                <h2>Common Questions About Beginner Chess Coaching</h2>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-list">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I really learn chess if I've never played before?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely! My beginner chess coaching is designed specifically for people with zero chess knowledge. I start from the very basics like how to set up the board and how each piece moves. Thousands of people learn chess every day, and with proper guidance, anyone can learn. The key is having a patient teacher who explains things clearly, which is exactly what I provide.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does it take to learn chess as a beginner?</h3>
                    <p>Most beginners can learn the basic rules and start playing enjoyable games within 4-6 sessions of 1 hour each. However, developing stronger skills and strategy takes a few months with regular practice. I recommend weekly 1-2 sessions for steady progress. Within 3 months of consistent learning, you'll be able to play confidently and understand intermediate concepts.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Am I too old to learn chess?</h3>
                    <p>Not at all! Chess can be learned at any age. I've taught students ranging from 7 years old to 75 years old. Adults often learn faster than children because they can grasp strategic concepts more quickly. The mental benefits of chess, like improved memory and problem-solving, are especially valuable for adults and seniors.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I'm a slow learner or struggle with strategy games?</h3>
                    <p>Everyone learns at their own pace, and that's completely fine. My teaching adapts to your speed. If you need more time on a concept, we spend more time. I use multiple explanation methods (visual, verbal, practical) to match different learning styles. Many of my successful students initially thought they couldn't learn chess, but with the right teaching approach, they excelled.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to buy a chess set or any equipment?</h3>
                    <p>For online sessions, no physical equipment is needed. We use digital boards during lessons. However, I do recommend getting an inexpensive chess set for practicing at home, as physical practice helps reinforce learning. A basic chess set costs around ₹200-500 and is a worthwhile investment.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will you give me homework or practice assignments?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. To keep your brain active and help reinforce concepts, I share simple and enjoyable practice tasks after sessions. These are designed for beginners and are completely stress-free. They typically take 15-20 minutes and significantly improve your learning speed. The homework is optional but highly recommended for best results.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What makes your teaching different from YouTube videos or apps?</h3>
                    <p>YouTube videos and apps are great for general information, but they can't give you personalized feedback, answer your specific questions, or adapt to your learning pace. In my sessions, I can see exactly where you're struggling and adjust my teaching immediately. Plus, having a real person to guide you keeps you motivated and accountable, which is crucial for beginners.</p>
