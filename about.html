                    <p class="lead-text">I'm a personal chess coach based in Mumbai, dedicated to helping beginners discover the joy of chess and improve their game from the ground up.</p>
                    
                    <p>My journey with chess began years ago, and it has been an incredible adventure of learning, competing, and growing. I've had the honor of winning multiple Inter-College Chess Competitions, which taught me not just the technical aspects of the game, but also the mental discipline, strategic thinking, and patience that chess demands.</p>
                    
                    <p>What truly drives me is seeing my students progress. Whether it's a complete beginner learning how pieces move, a child winning their first school tournament, or an adult improving their rating from 800 to 1200, these moments of growth are what make coaching so rewarding.</p>
                    
                    <p>I believe chess is for everyone, regardless of age or background. My teaching philosophy is simple: make chess accessible, enjoyable, and achievable for every student.</p>

                            <p>I never assume prior knowledge. I start from the absolute basics and build a strong foundation. No question is too simple, and no concept is rushed. My goal is to ensure every student feels confident at each step before moving forward.</p>

                <h2>Why I Love Teaching Chess</h2>
                <p class="lead-text">Teaching chess is more than just a profession for me, it's a passion.</p>
                
                <p>There's something incredibly fulfilling about watching a student's eyes light up when they finally understand a concept they've been struggling with. That moment when a beginner executes their first successful tactic, or when a student proudly shows me a game they won using a strategy we practiced together, these are the moments that remind me why I do this.</p>
                
                <p>Chess has given me so much: discipline, analytical thinking, patience, and resilience. Through coaching, I have the privilege of passing these benefits to others. Whether I'm teaching a 7-year-old child or a 70-year-old senior citizen, the joy of learning chess is universal.</p>
                
                <p>I love seeing the transformation in my students. They don't just become better chess players, they become better thinkers. They learn to plan ahead, consider multiple possibilities, and make decisions under pressure. These are life skills that extend far beyond the chessboard.</p>

                    <h3>Beginner Specialization</h3>
                    <p>Many coaches prefer working with advanced players. I specialize in beginners because I remember what it was like to start. I know the common struggles, the confusing concepts, and the breakthrough moments. This empathy makes me exceptionally effective with new learners.</p>

                    <h3>Personalized Attention</h3>
                    <p>I only take limited students to ensure everyone gets my full attention. Unlike group classes where individual needs get lost, my 1-on-1 sessions are completely tailored to your pace, goals, and learning style. Your progress is my priority.</p>
